Description: Provides a brms-like interface for fitting Bayesian regression models 
    using INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations). The package offers 
    faster model fitting while maintaining familiar brms syntax and output formats.
    Supports fixed and mixed effects models, multiple probability distributions, 
    conditional effects plots, and posterior predictive checks with summary methods compatible with brms. Methods are based on Rue et al. (2009) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2008.00700.x> "Approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models by using integrated nested Laplace approximations", BÃ¼rkner (2017) <doi:10.18637/jss.v080.i01> "brms: An R Package for Bayesian Multilevel Models using Stan", and Kruschke (2014, ISBN:9780124058880) "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan".
