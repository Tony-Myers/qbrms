\title{Hurdle Families for Two-Part Models}
\usage{
hurdle_poisson(link = "log", link.hu = "logit")

hurdle_negbinomial(link = "log", link.hu = "logit")
}
\arguments{
\item{link}{Link function for count component (default: "log")}

\item{link.hu}{Link function for hurdle component (default: "logit")}
}
\value{
A family object for use with qbrms()
}
\description{
Hurdle models for count data, separating zero vs non-zero process.
}
\details{
Two-part models: first part models zero vs non-zero probability,
second part models positive counts. Different from zero-inflation
as zeros only come from the hurdle process.
