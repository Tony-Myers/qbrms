A family object suitable for use with qbrms()

\description{
Log-normal distribution for modeling positive continuous data.
Useful when the log of the response is approximately normally distributed.

Lognormal distribution family for positive continuous responses
}
\details{
The log-normal distribution is appropriate for positive data that may be
right-skewed. It's equivalent to assuming log(Y) ~ Normal(μ, σ²).

Response variable must be strictly positive (> 0).

\dontrun{
# Basic log-normal regression

# Alternative link functions
fit <- qbrms(response ~ predictor, data = data, family = lognormal("log"))

# Lognormal regression 
fit <- qbrms(response ~ predictor, data = data, family = lognormal())
